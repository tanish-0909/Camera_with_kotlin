# Camera_with_kotlin_jetpack_compose
This is a mini project where I learnt how to use the mobile's camera to capture images.
This is the most basic version of the camera app where it clicks the image and then stores it to an external storage like SD card or hard drive or USB.
Later I should try the new cameraX feature and make a better version of this application.
